##Search Methods:
For our experiment, we compared the results of five different search methods. The first two were the **hill climber** and **random search** we started with. Our three new search implementations were variations on simulated annealing. We call them **pseudo-annealing**, **simple-annealing**, and **annealing**.

Our data represents 100 runs of each search method, on each problem, with 1000 iterations.

## Results

The Hill climber and annealing methods seem to be far superior to the other 3 methods. Simple annealing is somewhere in the middle, and pseudo annealing seems to be only little better (if at all) than random search.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
data_50_runs <- read.csv("../data/group2_combined_data.txt", sep="")
data_1000 <- data_50_runs[data_50_runs$Max_evals == 1000,]

plot(data_1000$Score ~ data_1000$Search_method,
     xlab="Searcher", ylab="Score",names=c("annealing", "h_climb", "pseudo_a", "random", "simple_a"))

pairwise.wilcox.test(data_1000$Score, data_1000$Search_method)
```
